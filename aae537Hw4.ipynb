    "For the first part of this assignment, I will be labeling out how to find the stagnation temperature at each station in the engine as well as the fuel/air ratios in the burner and afterburner. We will assume that q, $\\beta$, CPR, $C_p$, $\\Delta H_B$ (of the fuel), $\\dot{m}_0$, T$_{t4}$, and T$_{t7}$ are all known terms. We will also assume we know the efficiencies of the engine, that is, we know $\\eta_c, \\eta_b, \\eta_t, \\eta_{ab},$ and $\\eta_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inlet\n",
    "For the inlet, we will use the use the atmospheric conditions at a given altitude as given by the atmospheric model NASA provides at https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/atmosmet.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "From static pressure we can also find the mach. Assuming $\\gamma=1.33$ (or that $\\gamma$ is at least a known value) and assuming the ambient air acts like an ideal gas we know:\n",
    "$$M_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\cdot q}{\\gamma\\cdot P_{s0}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with static temperature and mach, we find total temperature at the inlet as:\n",
    "$$T_{t0} = T_{s0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_0^2\\right)$$\n",
    "From this, we will assume an adiabatic intake - thus $T_{t0} = T_{t2}$. Next, by using the inlet recovery per Mil Std 5008B we can define the piecewise function for pressure ratio as:\n",
    "$\\frac{P_{t2}}{P_{t0}} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  1 & \\text{for }M_0 <  1\\\\\n",
    "  1 - 0.075(M_0-1)^{1.35} & \\text{for } 1< M_0 < 5\\\\\n",
    "  \\frac{800}{M_0^4+935} & \\text{for } M_0 > 5 \n",
    "\\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since stagnation pressure can be calculated as the sum of static and dynamic pressures, we find $P_{t0} = P_{s0} + q$ where $P_{s0}$ is the pressure found from the atmospheric model. From this we can find the total pressure at station 2 from $P_{t2} = P_{t0} \\cdot \\left(P_{t2}/P_{t0}\\right)$.\n",
    "#### Compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "For the compressor we can find the stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure for the air by:\n",
    "$$T_{t3} = T_{t2}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\eta_c}\\cdot\\left(CPR^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}-1\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "$$P_{t3} = P_{t2}\\cdot CPR$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also want to find the massflow running through the core. Since we know $\\beta$ and the inlet massflow $\\dot{m}$, the massflow going through the core would be:\n",
    "$$ \\dot{m}_c = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\beta+1}$$\n",
    "#### Burner\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto the burner, $T_{t4}$ is a given value and we will assume that $P_{t4} = P_{t3}$. We can find the fuel to air ratio by:\n",
    "$$f = \\frac{T_{t4} - T_{t3}}{\\Delta H_B}\\cdot C_p$$\n",
    "#### Turbine\n",
    "\n",
    "Station 5, within the figure, looks like it occurs before the re-mixing of the core and bypass streams. Thus, we will assume that the massflow out of the core at stage 5 is $\\dot{m}_c + \\dot{m}_f$. With this value, we will use powerbalance between the compressor and the turbine to determine the total temperature at the end of the turbine. Indeed:\n",
    "$$T_{t5} = T_{t4} - \\frac{\\dot{m}_c\\cdot C_p\\cdot(T_{t3}-T_{t2})}{(\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f)\\cdot C_p}$$\n",
    "And from this, we can use isentropic relations to find:\n",
    "$$P_{t5} = P_{t4}\\left(\\frac{T_{t5}}{T_{t4}}\\right)^\\frac{\\gamma}{(\\gamma-1)}$$\n",
    "#### Mixer\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the figure, by the time we reach station 6 the bypass flow has rejoined. Thus, the massflow now includes the bypass flow which we will need to account for. For this, we will perform weighted averages (thus assuming a constant area mixer).\n",
    "$$T_{t6} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_b}{\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f+\\dot{m}_b}\\cdot T_{t2} + \\frac{\\dot{m}_c + \\dot{m}_f} {\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f+\\dot{m}_b} \\cdot T_{t5}$$\n",
    "$$P_{t6} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_b}{\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f+\\dot{m}_b}\\cdot P_{t2} + \\frac{\\dot{m}_c + \\dot{m}_f} {\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f+\\dot{m}_b} \\cdot P_{t5}$$\n",
    "#### Afterburner\n",
    "\n",
    "At the afterburner, $T_{t7}$ is a given value and we will again assume that $P_{t7}=P_{t6}$. We will now perform an energy balance. Assuming a constant $C_p$ we can derive the following:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(\\dot{m}_b+\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f+\\dot{m}_{AB})C_pT_{t7} &= (\\dot{m}_b+\\dot{m}_c+\\dot{m}_f)C_pT_{t6} + \\dot{m}_{AB}\\Delta H_b\\eta_{ab}\\\\\n",
    "\\left(\\beta + 1 + f + \\frac{\\dot{m}_{AB}}{\\dot{m}_c}\\right)C_pT_{t7} &= (\\beta + 1 + f)C_pT_{t6} + \\frac{\\dot{m}_{AB}}{\\dot{m}_c}\\Delta H_b\\eta_{AB}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\dot{m}_{AB}}{\\dot{m}_c} &= \\frac{(\\beta + 1 + f)C_pT_{t6} - (\\beta + 1 + f)C_pT_{t7}}{C_pT_{t7}-\\Delta H_b\\eta_{AB}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "At this point, we will assume that the combuster is performing at stoichiometric conditions and thus the only air coming into the afterburner was air that went through the bypass. Thus:\n",
    "$$f_{ab} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{AB}}{\\dot{m}_b}$$\n",
    "Thus, we take the derived relation and multiply each side by $\\beta^{-1}$ to obtain:\n",
    "$$f_{ab} = \\frac{(\\beta + 1 + f)C_pT_{t6} - (\\beta + 1 + f)C_pT_{t7}}{C_pT_{t7}-\\Delta H_b\\eta_{AB}} \\cdot \\beta^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nozzle\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfectly expanded nozzle means that $P_9 = P_0$ and that $P_{t9} = P_{t7}$. We will also assume this is an adiabatic process and thus $T_{t9} = T_{t7}$. We can then find the velocity at the exit by:\n",
    "$$V_9 = \\sqrt{2C_pT_{t9}\\eta_n\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{P_9}{P_{t9}}\\right)^\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\right)}$$\n"
